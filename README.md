# InvaPact Synthesis Code & Data Page
<img align="right" src="www/InvaPact logo.jpg" alt="InvaPact logo" width="250" style="margin-top: 20px">

This is the project page for InvaPact synthesis code and data, formalised at <a href="https://www.biodiversitydynamics.fr/invapact3links/">InvaPact III</a> (Le Mas Sant Joan, Spain) from 1-7 November 2025). The organisation page consolidates synthesis code and data repositories for analysing the <em>InvaPact</em> database. 

InvaPact aims to standardise all ecological impacts of biological invasions into a single, simple metric, so that they can be compiled accros invasive species, invaded regions, ecosystems and habitats, to allow quantification, compilation, comparison, and analyses of trends and correlates to various drivers.

This sub-section of the InvaPact organisation page is maintained by @<a href="https://github.com/cjabradshaw">cjabradshaw</a>, but anyone associated with InvaPact who has a Github account can contribute.

- Because this is a repository within the greater InvaPact organisation page on Github, the standard collection of repositories must be handled a little differently. Each new project will occupy a subfolder within the '[sections]([projects](https://github.com/InvaPact/InvaPactSynthesis/sections))' folder of this repository. Subsequent sub-folder structure (e.g., data, scripts, etc.) can be created for under each project name.
- All contributions are welcome, see this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) on best practices when making your contributions. 
- When commiting changes, please include informative commit messages. Here is a [guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) on how to write good commit descriptions.
- If you have any issue or request, please write it in the [issues](https://github.com/InvaPact/InvaPactSynthesis/issues) tab, so other people with similar issues can find it.
- General discussion items and threads can be initiated in the [Discussions](https://github.com/InvaPact/InvaPactSynthesis/discussions) tab.
