# InvaPact Workshop Code & Data Page

This is the project page for InvaPact synthesis code and data, formalised at <a href="https://www.biodiversitydynamics.fr/invapact3links/">InvaPact III</a> (Le Mas Sant Joan, Spain) from 1-7 November 2025). The organisation page consolidates synthesis code and data repositories for analysing the <em>InvaPact</em> database. 

InvaPact aims to standardise all ecological impacts of biological invasions into a single, simple metric, so that they can be compiled accros invasive species, invaded regions, ecosystems and habitats, to allow quantification, compilation, comparison, and analyses of trends and correlates to various drivers.
